Сode editor displays all the components and their props that you can see on the screen. You can also work with the components, their props, and values much faster than on the page. You need to be able to follow JSX syntax and know the set of available components, CSS props, and values.

### Code editor commands

If no changes are saved, a dot appears to the right of the tab name. To apply changes to the code, press the key combination `Ctrl` + `S` or `⌘(Cmd)` + `S` for MacOS, or close the tab.
