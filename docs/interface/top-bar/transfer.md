The project menu now allows you to transfer a project to a new owner. Specify the recipient's email address and send a request. A new owner accepts or refuses to transfer a project. A list of collaborators remains unchanged.
A project owner can create share links, delete collaborators and now assign another owner.

## How to transfer the project to another owner


1. If you own a project, click on the arrow next to the project name in the top bar to show the menu.
